Hey there! I’m Pranav Khetarpal, an undergrad at IIT Delhi who’s always juggling civil engineering, computer science, and a love for all things AI. You’ll usually find me trying to crack the secrets of machine learning or wondering why my Americano keeps looking suspiciously like a cappuccino (PS: It's the crema).

These days, alongside my classes and research projects, I’ve been working on an AI startup that’s currently in stealth mode. It’s an exciting challenge that’s taking up most of my time, but it’s thrilling to be part of something that could potentially redefine how AI integrates into everyday life.

At UniverseTBD, I’m part of a team that’s making an AI researcher, but more realistic and human friendly rather than a simple AI bot away from humans and humanity like most other groups. Trying to find that perfect balance of human-AI interactions. We’re building AI tools to help researchers and creating open-source projects that might just change the way we see the universe. Think foundation models for astronomy and pipelines that combine vision and language. Yes, it’s as exciting as it sounds, and yes, I do get to feel like a space scientist sometimes! (the person at Frankfurt immigration called me one)

Over here at IIT Delhi, at M3RG Lab, we’re on a mission to sprinkle some AI magic on material science. Imagine teaching AI to read chemistry papers and figure out experimental results better than most humans—that’s the kind of stuff we’re up to. Imagine making it easy to find what material you want to just based off of its properties. Imagine letting LLMs be able to use these tools to help in real world material discovery. It’s not all serious though; I can’t help but chuckle when AI stumbles over the same jargon that trips up the rest of us.

Outside of labs, I love to geek out on Twitter about everything from cricket matches at 5 AM to the latest drama and strategy in Formula 1. I’ve also been known to dive into philosophical debates about whether Max Verstappen really is unbeatable, if my favorite driver can pull off an underdog win, or if AI is quietly plotting to take over my job (spoiler: it’s probably just making coffee suggestions).

When I’m not coding or tweeting, I’m probably experimenting with retrieval-augmented generation systems, playing around with knowledge graphs, or helping friends build bots—all while pretending I totally didn’t mess up deleting a conda environment last week.

Life’s a mix of building, learning, and occasionally shouting “Eureka!” (even when it’s just figuring out why my ML model finally worked). So, let’s connect, chat about AI, or just share some Formula-1 memes. After all, science and fun go hand in hand, right?
