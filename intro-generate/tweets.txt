We just get so busy in figuring out how to do it, we forget if we even should? And what impact will it have on everything other than humans.

Tweet: One big thing I‚Äôve noticed in civil engineering: there‚Äôs surprisingly little focus on the environmental impacts of massive projects. 
It might be rooted in historical practices, but even now, when we know better, it feels like nobody really seems to care.

Tweet: played/seen chess, those nodes would be more readily available for the "reasoning model" but as the model loops or goes further in depths, like test-time scaling with iterations, for deeper iterations, the long term memory graph keeps expanding?
