@errai34 🥳🥳
I guess it’s an engineering thing, not only in civil engineering but everywhere.
One big thing I’ve noticed in civil engineering: there’s surprisingly little focus on the environmental impacts of massive projects.
One last dance… :))

played/seen chess, those nodes would be more readily available for the "reasoning model" but as the model loops or goes further in depths, like test-time scaling with iterations, for deeper iterations, the long term memory graph keeps expanding?
and using this weight function, we can organise this long term memory graph in a way that some "memory-nodes" are more relevant at some particular time.
extra info in form of environment variables observed by the model/robot at that moment, from temperature and people around to lumination, objects around, images, people, etc.
We can have a short term and a long term memory, the short term feeds to the long term memory, but not 100%.
Just a random thought?

Maybe just the calm before the storm? Or maybe I'm just an anxious guy:)).
And trust me, this year was full of so many failures, but it still doesn't feel bad. Does not feel incomplete.
It's after quite a while that a year has ended so peacefully for me. I have never been this content and relaxed when on new years before.
It honestly is such a simple implementation of RAG plus some good scrapers, but companies are going around selling this for millions!!

But still is it as groundbreaking?
I was just thinking… the way scientists are celebrating new super powerful LLMs like o3 or o1-pro. And with all the work around hypothesis generation, can these LLMs ever come up with theories? Or the best they can do are mini changes? Small ideas?
I hate how good o-1 is at programming sometimes and I fear my future as a human!

and they might've easily gotten mixed directly or indirectly into these models' train sets... Is it possible? Am I just too suspicious, of course a company like oAI will not do this.
One thing that I've been thinking... o3 and o1 getting such high performances on these benchmarks at ~80%... Why does this number feel like they have been trained on it?
Shameless plug😛
Also, @sama @OpenAI y’all tested on GPQA, what was your performance on our multimodal benchmark? Can we have some MaCBench scores too? https://t.co/g8fUxk39Rq
I agree Apple and this is not a great comparison, but it’s frustrating at times! Don’t wanna see one or two brands take complete control over all the things, especially when AI is going to be so much part of our lives!
I get the whole market competition thing but ai started as open source research… Open AI was meant to be open-sourced.
Yet, we have no idea about so many things openai or Google is doing with these models. Even if it is test time scaling… how exactly are they doing it?
How do software patents work? Are they not that easy to defend? I need to read up on them
With o1, and now o3 and all this hype around Transformers, are we neglecting other aspects of ML? There's more to things than just text.
@astro_nolan Will us humans be part of it? Or should I start farming? I don't even know how to farm though😭
Okay I’m a little concerned now… @astro_nolan say something positive please! https://t.co/g8fUxk39Rq
@errai34 I just wish they shared their secrets with all of us… miss the times when all the working of these models used to be released in research papers
Orr… it could be with the image part, cause that is something most models are not upto the mark at yet… so it could be something like that!
Okay… using the GPT-4 and o1 in last 2 weeks have made me realise it’s better at agentic control and those kinds of stuff.
I was deleting a conda environment and instead of conda env list I did conda list env, and it showed an empty list... for a second I almost lost it... I thought I lost everything, all at once!
