      <h3>Probing the limitations of multimodal language models for chemistry and materials research</h3>
      <p class="publication-description">
        A comprehensive benchmark for evaluating how vision-language models handle real-world chemistry and materials science tasks across three core aspects: data extraction, experimental understanding, and results interpretation.
        This paper was published in 2024, and currently under review for publishing in Nature Computational Science Journal.

        <h3>AstroLLaMa</h3>
        <p class="publication-description">
            AstroLLaMA is a 7B-parameter model fine-tuned on 300,000 astronomy abstracts, achieving 30% lower perplexity than LLaMA-2. It excels in text generation and embedding tasks, supporting astronomy research through its public release.
