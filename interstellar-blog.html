        <!-- ============================ PREFACE ============================ -->
        <!-- <h2>Preface</h2> -->
        <p><strong>This was my mail to my professor:</strong></p>
        <blockquote>
          <code>
            I am writing to confirm my proposed topic for the term paper in CVL871: Durability and Repair of Concrete Structures. 
            I would like to focus on the design, durability, and repairability of reinforced concrete structures under extreme 
            environmental conditions, using Mann’s planet from the film <em>Interstellar</em> (the icy one) as a case study.
            <br><br>
            Mann’s planet presents several challenges—such as extremely low temperatures (approximately negative 244 °C), 
            reduced gravity, severe thermal cycling (with a temperature range of 50 °C in a day), and chemical exposures 
            (high ammonia atmosphere). These conditions offer an interesting opportunity to explore how conventional 
            materials might be adapted or re-engineered for such environments.
            <br><br>
            {Note: Since it’s a fictional planet, for the estimates of the above-mentioned environmental conditions, 
            my primary source would be Reddit and Physics Stack Exchange.}
          </code>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>
          I will be using OpenAI and Perplexity Deep Research to get a broad background of the planet; visit the sources for more detailed information; 
          and then look for scientific civil engineering literature for solutions of the conditions/problems the planet presents. Let’s hope this 
          fun experiment provides us with something interesting and we learn something that can be used/applied on our planet’s “classical” construction too.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
        <p><em><strong>“Dr. Mann, tell us about your world”</strong> – “Our world, we hope. Our world is cold, stark, but undeniably beautiful. The days 
        are 67 hours long, cold, the nights are 67 far colder hours. The gravity is a very-very pleasant 80% of the Earth’s. Now up here, where I 
        landed, the water is alkali and the air has too much ammonia in it to breathe for more than just a few minutes, but down at the surface, 
        and there <em>is</em> surface, the chlorine dissipates. The ammonia gives a way to crystalline hydrocarbons and breathable air, to organics, 
        possibly even to life. We might be sharing this world.”</em></p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          We later realize in the movie that all the readings were faked by Dr.&nbsp;Mann, and there is no surface below (as pointed out by Prof.&nbsp;Bishnoi too). 
          I am going to ignore this fact and write the paper from the perspective of a ground engineer who is designing the structures according to the 
          “fake” readings relayed by Dr.&nbsp;Mann to the dying planet Earth. I do realize that the “surface” detail will be the fatal flaw in my whole paper, 
          but it is the only way I can design something.
        </p>

        <p>I will start the actual paper now, hope you like it :)</p>

        <!-- ============================ INTRODUCTION ============================ -->
        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Dr. Mann’s planet in <em>Interstellar</em> is depicted as an ice-covered world orbiting the blackhole Gargantua. It has an extremely cold, inhospitable 
          environment characterized by a thick, toxic atmosphere and unusual terrain with frozen clouds.
        </p>
        <p>
          I propose a solution to design a durable concrete structure on the planet which serves a design life of 150 years and has a high repairability as a structure. 
          This paper is supposed to be a thought experiment to see how concrete would behave in extremely unlikely and abnormal conditions, 
          and what we can change in the current philosophy of Reinforced concrete structures to better handle these conditions providing a long durable life of the structure.
        </p>

        <!-- ============================ PLANETARY CONDITIONS ============================ -->
        <h2>2. Planetary Conditions</h2>

        <!-- 2.1 Atmosphere -->
        <h3>2.1 Atmosphere</h3>

        <h4>2.1.1 Ammonia</h4>
        <p>
          The planet’s air is unbreathable due to high concentrations of ammonia. Dr.&nbsp;Mann’s notes state that 
          “the air has too much ammonia to breathe for more than a few minutes” [1]. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 
          has set a 15-minute exposure limit for gaseous ammonia of 35&nbsp;ppm by volume in the environmental air and an 8-hour exposure limit of 25&nbsp;ppm by volume [2]. 
          This implies an ammonia level well above human safety limits (~25&nbsp;ppm).
        </p>
        <p>
          Although the concentration is likely still far below the 16–25% (160,000–250,000&nbsp;ppm) needed for flammability, 
          we observe that no ignition occurs during the shuttle’s flight or when KIPP self-destructs.
        </p>

        <h4>2.1.2 Chlorine</h4>
        <p>
          Trace amounts of chlorine are also hinted in dialogue, with Mann claiming “the chlorine dissipates” at lower altitudes.
        </p>

        <h4>2.1.3 Pressure</h4>
        <p>
          Overall atmospheric pressure is not stated explicitly, but the presence of dense cloud layers suggests a thick, heavy atmosphere (higher density than Earth’s). 
          Despite this density, humans cannot survive outside without suits due to toxicity and low oxygen. 
          The atmosphere likely consists of nitrogen, ammonia, and possibly carbon dioxide; indeed, frozen CO<sub>2</sub> clouds 
          (“dry ice” clouds) are mentioned [3].
        </p>
        <p>
          These gases create a corrosive, suffocating mix—deadly to breathe and inhospitable to Earth life.
        </p>

        <!-- 2.2 Temperature and Climate -->
        <h3>2.2 Temperature and Climate</h3>
        <p>
          The surface environment is frigid. Daytime temperature remain below the freezing point of pure water, around 0&nbsp;°C, 
          and could drop near the freezing point of ammonia, –77.8&nbsp;°C [4,5]. Days last 67 hours and nights another 67 hours, 
          indicating a slow rotation (~134-hour day) [1]. During the long daytime, the sun (Gargantua’s disk illumination or possibly the neutron star mentioned by Cooper) 
          provides some warming but not enough to thaw the ice. Nights are far colder, plunging the already sub-zero temperatures even lower [1].
        </p>
        <p>
          No seasonal variation was mentioned; however, the planet’s elliptical eccentric orbit likely causes cycles of periodic warming, 
          but not enough to melt any ice or cause major physical changes. As the planet swings closer to Gargantua’s accretion disk, temperatures rise slightly, 
          causing surface ices (CO<sub>2</sub>, etc.) to sublimate, and then refreeze when it travels farther out [7,4]. 
          There is no indication of liquid water or precipitation — only cycles of sublimation and frost.
        </p>
        <p>
          The climate appears windy and harsh: scenes show constant winds blowing ice crystals, and an atmosphere thick with blowing snow/fog. 
          No intense storms (like the tidal waves on Miller’s planet) are shown, but localized blizzards or ground blizzards are plausible.
        </p>

        <!-- 2.3 Gravity and Time Dilation -->
        <h3>2.3 Gravity and Time Dilation</h3>
        <p>
          The planet’s gravity is a “very pleasant 80% of Earth’s” according to Dr.&nbsp;Mann. This corresponds to approximately ~7.8&nbsp;m/s<sup>2</sup>.<br/>
          Time dilation on Mann’s planet is minimal compared to Miller’s planet. Being further from Gargantua, gravitational time dilation is negligible—essentially 
          similar to Earth’s. The Endurance crew does not experience significant relative aging on Mann’s world [8]. 
          Thus, we can treat 1 hour on Mann’s planet as roughly 1 hour on Earth (differences on the order of microseconds).
        </p>

        <!-- 2.4 Terrain and Surface -->
        <h3>2.4 Terrain and Surface</h3>
        <p>
          The most unusual thing was that no solid surface was ever found. The terrain consisted of “seemingly endless layers of frozen clouds” — 
          a vast honeycomb of ice layers and voids [4,9]. From orbit, the planet appeared as a frozen white ball. 
          On the “surface” where the crew lands, they are actually on a thick slab of solid cloud — essentially a cloud deck that has frozen into ice [4]. 
          These frozen clouds form jagged, mountainous structures; the film shows giant vertical ice formations resembling upside-down mountains looming over the characters [4].
        </p>
        <p>
          Beneath the landing layer, there are likely multiple lower layers of frozen atmosphere. Dr.&nbsp;Mann surmised that a solid planetary crust might lie far below, 
          but all his probes failed to find bedrock, indicating the ice layers could extend deep or even all the way down to a theorized ocean or core [4].
        </p>

            The film’s production used Svínafellsjökull glacier in Iceland to represent this terrain, emphasizing the crevassed, 
            frozen surface [9].
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <!-- 2.5 Orbital and Lighting Conditions -->
        <h3>2.5 Orbital and Lighting Conditions</h3>
        <p>
          Mann’s planet orbits Gargantua on a highly elliptical orbit. Thorne deduced that it swings from a far distance (approximately 600 R<sub>g</sub>) 
          at apastron to very close near perihelion [22]. Like Halley’s Comet in our solar system, it plunges inward and then travels far out, 
          which could cause extreme tidal forces and periodic heating [22]. To avoid plunging through the intense radiation of the disk, 
          the orbit is tilted out of Gargantua’s equatorial plane [22]. Thorne describes the accretion disk as “anemic and at low temperature — 
          about the temperature of the surface of the Sun,” which emits enough light to see but not lethal levels of UV or X-rays [22].
        </p>

        <!-- 2.6 Geology and Activity -->
        <h3>2.6 Geology and Activity</h3>
        <p>
          Mann’s planet appears geologically dead on the surface — no volcanoes, no tectonic motion is observed. 
          However, the strong tidal forces from its eccentric orbit could cause internal heating. 
          There is speculation (in fan analyses and Thorne’s interpretation) that the planet might have some internal warmth 
          or even a subsurface ocean kept liquid by tidal flexing [10].
        </p>
        <p>
          Erosion on this world happens through sublimation and re-freezing of atmospheric ice, rather than liquid water erosion. 
          The landscape’s fissures and canyons likely result from the ice layers slowly sinking or cracking under their own weight and thermal cycling. 
          Seismic activity is not mentioned, but the collapse Romilly triggers by breaching the robot’s core indicates the ice can fracture dramatically.
        </p>
        <p>
          One more aspect of this planet that was discussed quite bleakly until now is the water where Dr.&nbsp;Mann landed, which is alkali. 
          Not much about this is discussed in the movie or in any online forums that may be relevant.
        </p>

        <!-- ============================ IMPACT ON RC STRUCTURES ============================ -->
        <h2>3. Mann’s planet’s impact on classical RC structures (and recommended solutions)</h2>
        <p>
          Following the above planetary description, I will go step by step through each property of our hypothetical planet 
          and mention what influence it will have on our current construction process with regards to the materials and their durability. 
          And then I will mention what are the possible solutions or changes that can be implemented to handle these scenarios.
        </p>

        <!-- 3.1 Ammonia Atmosphere -->
        <h3>3.1 Ammonia Atmosphere</h3>
        <p><strong>Impact of ammonia environment on steel reinforcement [11,12]:</strong></p>
        <p>
          Ammonia is highly soluble in water, reducing the pH of concrete. On Mann’s planet, ammonia can dissolve and enter the concrete 
          during initial mixing stages and persist for over 10&nbsp;years. This long-term presence lowers the concrete’s pH 
          (from 12–13.5 in normal mixes), accelerating corrosion of steel rebars. The reduced pH due to ammonia exposure 
          compromises the passive oxide layer that normally protects steel reinforcement [11].
        </p>
        <p>
          One benefit of the planet’s extremely cold environment is minimal moisture and relative humidity around the structure. 
          This negligible RH limits the dissolution of NH<sub>3</sub>. In other words, dried concrete exposed to the surrounding air 
          will not readily allow ammonia to dissolve into an aqueous state and attack the rebars.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Impact of ammonia environment on concrete [11,13]:</strong></p>
        <p>
          Ammonia in the environment can react with calcium hydroxide in concrete, removing essential calcium compounds from the cement paste [11]. 
          As these reaction products are leached out, concrete permeability increases, allowing further penetration of ammonia 
          and other corrosive agents deeper into the structure [11].
        </p>
        <p>
          The chemical reactions between ammonia compounds and concrete reduce the material’s natural alkalinity, 
          undermining its resistance to various forms of deterioration [11]. In severe cases, concrete can be decalcified up to significant depths, weakening the outer layer. 
          Studies also indicate a drop in compressive strength when ammonium salts form within the cement matrix [13]. 
          At 28&nbsp;days, strength reductions of 25–35% have been observed in concrete contaminated with ammonia. 
          On Mann’s planet, the lower gravity (80% of Earth) partially offsets this loss in strength, but high safety factors must be applied in design.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="interstellar-blog/ammonia_strength.png" alt="Graph: Effect of ammonia on compressive strength" style="max-width:60%;">
          <figcaption>Compressive strength (28&nbsp;days) of mortar replaced with ammonia, showing negative effects of ammonia-contaminated fly ash [13].</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          If proper precautions are taken to avoid ammonia contamination of fresh concrete mix, the resulting strength losses can be managed. 
          Alternatively, using non-traditional rebars (e.g., stainless steel) instead of standard TMT bars can help avoid corrosion risks.
        </p>

        <!-- 3.2 Chlorine Atmosphere -->
        <h3>3.2 Chlorine Atmosphere</h3>
        <p>
          The impact of chlorine on concrete and reinforcement has been discussed extensively in the course. Below is a concise summary:
        </p>
        <h4>Impact on Concrete [14,15,16]</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Chloride Ingress:</strong> Chloride ions penetrate concrete through pores or microcracks, reacting with calcium hydroxide to form calcium oxychloride, 
              causing internal expansion and crumbling.</li>
          <li><strong>Increased Permeability:</strong> Chloride ingress increases concrete porosity, allowing deeper penetration of moisture and other corrosive agents.</li>
          <li><strong>Alkali–Silica Reaction (ASR):</strong> Chlorides can exacerbate ASR in susceptible aggregates, leading to cracking.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Impact on Rebars [17,18,19]</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Passive Layer Breakdown:</strong> Chlorides destroy the protective iron oxide layer on rebars, initiating corrosion. The corrosion products (rust) 
              expand and crack the surrounding concrete.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Because of these factors, it is critical to ensure that chloride ions do not dissolve into the fresh concrete mix. 
          Otherwise, the structure may deteriorate prematurely, compromising strength and service life. 
          Fortunately, the risk of chloride ingress after the concrete has hardened is minimal in Mann’s ultra-cold environment, 
          due to extremely low temperatures and relative humidity.
        </p>

        <!-- 3.3 High-Pressure Atmosphere -->
        <h3>3.3 High-Pressure Atmosphere</h3>
        <p>
          A higher-pressure atmosphere does not appear to significantly affect the health of concrete in most respects; 
          however, it can reduce the effectiveness of air-entraining agents (crucial for freeze–thaw resistance) [20]. 
          Under higher pressure, the pore structure during curing may be altered, potentially reducing porosity/permeability 
          but also limiting the concrete’s ability to accommodate freeze–thaw cycles [20].
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, the main long-term durability impact of a high-pressure atmosphere on Mann’s planet is the potential reduction in freeze–thaw resistance 
          due to altered air content. 
        </p>

        <!-- 3.4 Temperature and Climate -->
        <h3>3.4 Temperature and Climate</h3>
        <p>
          One of the most central properties on Mann’s planet is its temperature. Daytime temperatures range from about 0&nbsp;°C to –77&nbsp;°C, 
          and nighttime temperatures drop even further, resulting in a daily thermal cycling of roughly 50&nbsp;°C.
        </p>

        <h4>3.4.1 Impact of Ultra-Low Frigid Temperatures on Concrete [23–26]</h4>
        <p>
          When temperatures fall below 0&nbsp;°C, the cement hydration process effectively stops, preventing further strength gain. 
          If freshly placed concrete freezes, the water inside expands (~9%), creating internal pressure and microcracking. 
          Additionally, exposing plastic concrete to freezing can reduce its final strength by up to 50% due to disrupted hydration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond these chemical and physical changes, extreme temperature gradients induce thermal stresses that lead to cracking. 
          At temperatures nearing –150&nbsp;°C, severe thermal contraction can cause dramatic cracking in even fully cured concrete, 
          resulting in progressive material deterioration.
        </p>

        <h4>3.4.2 Impact of Ultra-Low Frigid Temperatures on Steel Reinforcements [27]</h4>
        <p>
          Mechanical properties of steel rebars vary significantly under extremely low temperatures. 
          Steel often shows increased yield and ultimate strengths in the cold, but ductility can drop, making it more brittle and prone to sudden failure. 
          Thermal contraction at –150&nbsp;°C also creates large internal stresses at the steel–concrete interface.
        </p>

        <h4>3.4.3 Construction Solutions for Ultra-Cold Environments [23–29]</h4>
        <p>
          Specialized concrete mixes with high early strength, low water–cement ratios, air-entrainment, 
          and possibly “anti-freeze” admixtures are key. Hot-rolled bars are preferred for their superior ductility, 
          though non-metallic reinforcements may be chosen if suitable. Advanced methods like insulated formwork, heated enclosures, 
          and real-time monitoring help maintain concrete temperature during curing. Adjustments in foundation design 
          (e.g., thermosyphons, flexible bases) can accommodate frost heave or ice shifts.
        </p>

        <!-- 3.5 Gravity and Time Dilation -->
        <h3>3.5 Gravity and Time Dilation</h3>
        <p>
          Gravity on Mann’s planet is ~80% of Earth’s. This effectively reduces certain design loads (self-weight, occupant loads) by ~20%, 
          but the overall design principles remain the same. Time dilation is negligible and does not affect the structure’s service life.
        </p>

        <!-- 3.6 Geology and Activity -->
        <h3>3.6 Geology and Activity</h3>
        <p>
          Since Mann’s planet is geologically dead at the surface, we do not need to consider major seismic or volcanic activity. 
          However, fracturing or drifting of the ice crust remains a concern.
        </p>

        <!-- ============================ CONCRETE MIX DESIGN ============================ -->
        <h2>4. Concrete Mix Design for Ultra-Cold and Thermal Shock</h2>
        <p>
          Designing concrete for –244&nbsp;°C is well beyond standard cold-weather concreting, but not without precedent. 
          On Earth, “cryogenic concrete” is used in LNG facilities (~–165&nbsp;°C). At cryogenic temperatures, 
          ordinary Portland cement concrete often gains strength but becomes more brittle due to ice formation in pores and thermal contraction.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Key mix strategies for ultra-cold:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Low Free Water &amp; Air-Entrained Pores:</strong> Use a low w/b ratio plus air-entraining admixtures 
              (~4–6% air) to accommodate freeze expansion.</li>
          <li><strong>SCMs (Fly Ash, GGBS, Silica Fume):</strong> These reduce free lime and refine pores, 
              decreasing internal water and vulnerability to freeze damage.</li>
          <li><strong>Cryogenic Admixtures &amp; Polymers:</strong> Anti-freeze admixtures can depress freezing point, 
              allowing hydration at subzero temps. Polymer modifiers can increase toughness.</li>
          <li><strong>Non-traditional Binders (e.g., Sulfur Concrete):</strong> Can avoid water-based hydration entirely, 
              eliminating issues with freezing water in pores.</li>
          <li><strong>Aggregate Selection:</strong> Choose aggregates with low thermal expansion and minimal internal porosity to reduce fracturing.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          A typical “cryo-concrete” might have 50–70% slag cement, some silica fume, w/b ~0.30, ~5% air entrainment, 
          and possibly polypropylene micro-fibers for crack control. Though stronger at –200&nbsp;°C, controlling brittleness is crucial.
        </p>

        <!-- ============================ REINFORCEMENT OPTIONS ============================ -->
        <h2>5. Reinforcement Options to Resist Extreme Corrosion</h2>
        <p>
          On Mann’s planet, rebar must handle cryogenic embrittlement and severe chemical exposure (ammonia/chlorine). 
          Regular carbon-steel bars become brittle and corrode quickly under chloride/ammonia ingress. 
          Below are key alternatives:
        </p>

        <h3>5.1 Stainless Steel Rebar</h3>
        <p>
          Widely used in LNG cryogenic tanks on Earth. Austenitic stainless steels (304, 316) maintain ductility at –196&nbsp;°C. 
          They also resist chloride-induced corrosion. Though more expensive, it is often the only viable option for critical cryogenic structures [30].
        </p>

        <h3>5.2 Fiber-Reinforced Polymer (FRP) Rebars</h3>
        <p>
          Non-metallic bars made of glass, basalt, or carbon fibers. They do not corrode, are lightweight, and have high tensile strength. 
          At very low temperatures, the resin matrix can become brittle if not formulated properly. Testing down to –100&nbsp;°C suggests 
          increased stiffness but potential microcracking at the fiber–matrix interface [36].
        </p>

        <h3>5.3 Fiber Additions / UHPC</h3>
        <p>
          Using steel or synthetic fibers throughout the concrete can reduce or eliminate conventional rebar. 
          For cryogenic conditions, special alloys or stainless steel fibers maintain ductility. UHPC (150–200&nbsp;MPa) 
          with dense microstructure also limits chemical ingress.
        </p>

        <h3>5.4 Coated or Clad Steel</h3>
        <p>
          Epoxy-coated steel can protect against corrosion, though standard epoxy may crack at –244&nbsp;°C. 
          Clad bars (stainless steel skin on carbon-steel core) offer a balance of cost and performance if the cladding is thick enough 
          and remains tough in the cold.
        </p>

        <h3>5.5 Prestressing Tendons</h3>
        <p>
          Prestressing keeps concrete in compression, reducing cracking. Specialized cryogenic strands (e.g., 9% Ni steel) maintain mechanical properties at –170&nbsp;°C [38]. 
          Post-tensioning with accessible external tendons also aids future maintenance.
        </p>

        <!-- ============================ PROTECTIVE COATINGS AND SEALERS ============================ -->
        <h2>6. Protective Coatings and Sealers for Chemical Attack</h2>
        <p>
          Even with the best concrete mix and stainless steel, Mann’s planet’s ammonia and chlorine demand extra surface protection. 
          In wastewater plants on Earth, NH<sub>3</sub> and Cl<sup>–</sup> can aggressively damage concrete. 
          Below are various protective systems:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Epoxy or Polyurethane Coatings:</strong> Common in chemical tanks. Need a cryogenic-grade formulation to avoid brittle failure at ~–244&nbsp;°C. 
              Must also handle daily ~50&nbsp;°C thermal swings.</li>
          <li><strong>Polyurea/Elastomeric Liners:</strong> Spray-applied, seamless membranes that can bridge cracks if they remain flexible at ultra-low temps.</li>
          <li><strong>Cementitious Crystalline Sealers (e.g., Xypex):</strong> Reduce water permeability and self-seal microcracks, but not a standalone solution 
              for extreme chemical attack.</li>
          <li><strong>Surface Densifiers and Penetrants (Silane, Silicates):</strong> Render concrete hydrophobic, slowing chemical ingress.</li>
          <li><strong>Physical Cladding:</strong> FRP wrap or metallic foil anchored to the concrete. Must manage differences in thermal expansion.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Increasing concrete cover or adding cathodic protection further safeguards steel, though stainless steel may not need it. 
          A practical strategy might be epoxy priming plus a polyurea topcoat, with careful detailing at joints.
        </p>

        <!-- ============================ STRUCTURAL STRATEGIES ============================ -->
        <h2>7. Structural Strategies for Building on Ice and Low Gravity</h2>
        <p>
          Mann’s planet has no solid ground—only thick ice. Combined with ~0.8g gravity, foundation design must adapt to potential ice movement, fracturing, or slow flow:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Spread the Load (“Snowshoe” Foundations):</strong> Use broad slabs/mats to keep bearing pressure low, akin to snowshoes on soft snow.</li>
          <li><strong>Skis and Skids:</strong> Similar to the British Antarctic Survey’s Halley&nbsp;VI station, place structures on giant skis so they can be 
              repositioned if the ice shifts.</li>
          <li><strong>Anchoring to Ice:</strong> Large auger-like anchors or friction piles can tie the structure down if needed. 
              Joints/flexible connections accommodate relative movement.</li>
          <li><strong>Floating Foundations:</strong> If a subsurface ocean exists, a buoyant “pontoon” base could be used, effectively creating an ice-locked vessel.</li>
        </ol>

        <!-- ============================ CONCLUSIONS ============================ -->
        <h2>8. Conclusions</h2>
        <p>
          Building with reinforced concrete on a world like Mann’s planet is extreme engineering at its finest. 
          It forces us to combine knowledge from cryogenic materials science, corrosion chemistry, polar engineering, and aerospace technology. 
          Our structure will essentially be a fortress of carefully chosen concrete mix, internally armored with stainless steel 
          and external shields of coatings, perched on adaptive foundations that cope with the ice. 
        </p>
        <p>
          By planning for every conceivable challenge — from microscopic freeze–thaw cracks to century-long chemical onslaughts — 
          we ensure that our extraterrestrial outpost can stand the test of time.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Thank You :)</strong></p>
